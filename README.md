# Glove Genius: AI-Powered Product Advisor for Sales Teams

## üìò Project Overview

**Glove Genius** is a web-based application designed to support sales representatives at Superior Glove Works in recommending appropriate hand safety products to customers. The application uses artificial intelligence to analyze customer needs and suggest the most suitable gloves or sleeves based on workplace conditions, safety requirements, and real-time stock levels.

This project addresses two key business challenges:
- Reducing the complexity and inconsistency in manual product matching
- Assisting sales reps in finding alternative recommendations when preferred items are low in stock

The AI-powered system ensures our salespeople can deliver high-quality recommendations with speed, accuracy, and reliability.

## üß© Use Case & Workflow

Sales reps regularly consult with customers to understand their work environments and hazards‚Äîsuch as electrical risk, extreme temperatures, or sharp instruments. Based on this, they suggest gloves or sleeves that match safety and performance needs (e.g., dexterity, cut resistance, fire resistance).

### Current Workflow Challenges:
- Manual catalog lookup can be time-consuming and inconsistent
- Stock shortages make substitutions difficult and error-prone
- New products or updates from ERP systems may not be immediately accessible

### AI-Enhanced Workflow:
1. Sales rep enters customer conditions via a web interface
2. The AI model, using RAG, searches internal product knowledge and stock levels
3. It suggests:
   - The most appropriate product
   - Alternatives if stock is low or unavailable
   - Justifications based on product attributes (e.g., ANSI cut level, heat resistance)

## üí¨ Example Prompts & Expected Outputs

### üîπ Prompt 1 ‚Äì Industry-Specific Needs
> "My customer works in food processing and needs a glove that is cut-resistant, offers high dexterity, and complies with food safety regulations. What should I recommend?"

### ‚úÖ Expected Output
- **Primary Recommendation**: TenActiv‚Ñ¢ S18TAXGFN
- **Attributes**: Cut Level A6, CFIA compliant, foam nitrile palm, high dexterity
- **Justification**: This glove is engineered for food-safe environments with a high cut rating (A6), a CFIA-compliant shell, and fine 18-gauge knit for maximum dexterity and tactile control.
- **Alternatives**: 
-    *TenActiv‚Ñ¢ STAGFN ‚Äì Lower cut level (A4) for less extreme conditions
-    *Emerald CX‚Ñ¢ ECX18G ‚Äì Also CFIA-approved with steel-reinforced fibers

## üìà Evaluation Strategy
‚Ä¢	Use of automated evaluation frameworks (e.g., LangChain evaluators or custom metrics) to compare AI recommendations against expert rules and historical rep suggestions

‚Ä¢	Feedback collection from sales reps via inline ratings and comments

‚Ä¢	Flagging logic to prevent AI from recommending items that are below minimum viable stock levels

---

## üîé Observability Plan
‚Ä¢	All prompts and outputs will be logged with metadata (rep ID, customer type, product suggested)

‚Ä¢	LangSmith will be used for:
  o	Prompt tracing and debugging
  o	Usage analytics
  o	Monitoring model drift and performance over time
  
‚Ä¢	Priority reviews for suggestions made to top-tier accounts

‚Ä¢	Alerting system to catch invalid outputs (e.g., no substitutions found, inaccurate hazard matching)
